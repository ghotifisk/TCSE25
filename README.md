# Introduction to the Tools of Scientific Computing

This repository contains the source code in the 2nd edition of the textbook [*Introduction to the Tools of Scientific Computing*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-16972-4) by Einar Smith, published in 2022 as part of the Springer-Verlag book series *Texts in Computational Science and Engineering* (TCSE, volume 25).

The collection can also serve as a supplement to the 1st edition of the textbook, which was published in 2020. Note, however, that some page references have changed. Some examples have been replaced with updated versions. The Mathematica and PyTorch programs are new to the second edition.

The repository now also contains a  bonus Fortran Chapter 17 not included in the book,  again together with the source code.
